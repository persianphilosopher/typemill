# Use Cases

Whenever you want to publish a finished text work as a website, then TYPEMILL is a smart and lightweight solution. Possible use cases are ...

- a book
- a drama
- a lyric collection
- a whitepaper
- a documentation
- a manual or user guide
- a handbook
- a tutorial
- a study
- a collection of articles

TYPEMILL is not a full blown Content Management System (CMS). It has no admin panel and it does not support any content creation right now. Instead, it takes some existing markdown files and generates a beautiful website. 

Use your favourite text or markdown editor (e.g. Typora) to create markdown files and upload them with a FTP software (e.g. FileZilla) to your server.

TYPEMILL is not the right solution, if you want to create a blog, a wiki or any website with an author interface. But it is a smart solution to publish any text work based on markdown files.
