# Roadmap

There are a lot of plans for future releases of TYPEMILL, but it also follows the concept of simplicity. To prevent TYPEMILL from becomming a feature soup, it will strictly focus on the writers needs. These are some ideas:  

- Right now a plugin system is in work to make typemill more extensible.
- An admin plugin is planned. With this, you can create content online.
- Image- and media-management is planned with the admin plugin.
- Clean API-design is planned.
- More options to create navigations.
- More themes for special publications like documentations, books or lyrics.
- Additional output format like mobi, epub, static html and more.

If you miss a feature or if you found a bug, please report it on GitHub.
