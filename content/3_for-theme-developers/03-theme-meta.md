# Theme Meta with YAML

You can add some meta-information to your theme with a small YAML-file. The YAML-file must have the same name as your theme folder. The yaml-file has some useful standard-information and looks like this:

```
name: My Theme Name
version: 1.0.0
description: Write what you want
author: Your name here
homepage: http://an-info-website-for-the-theme.com
licence: MIT
```

Why is this useful? Some reasons:

* The user can see, if his version is outdated and then update his theme to a actual version.
* You can add a licence, that is displayed in the setup.
* You can add your name as an author-name. This is also displayed in the setup.
* You can add a homepage with further informations and theme-updates, that is also displayed in the setup.

A YAML-file with meta-informations is not mandatory, so your theme will work without it. But it is highly recommended.
