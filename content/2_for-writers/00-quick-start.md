# Quick Start for Writers

You are a pro and don't want to read the whole manual? No problem, this is a quick overview:

- **Folders and files**: Organize your content in folders and markdown files and put them in the `\content` folder of TYPEMILL. 
- **Naming conventions**: Use prefixes like `01-` or `aa_` to sort your folders and files.
- **Markdown**: Use the Markdown syntax for your content files. Markdown Extra (e.g. tables, footnotes) is supported, too.
- **Index files**: Add an `index.md` file to a folder to create content for the folder itself.
- **F5**: After some changes, use the `F5` key to refresh the navigation manually.
- **Settings**: Use the file `settings.yaml` in the root folder to change the theme or other settings.
- **Lean back** and let TYPEMILL create a nice website for you.
