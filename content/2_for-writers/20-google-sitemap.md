# Google Sitemap

As of version 1.0.1, TYPEMILL creates a google sitemap in the cache folder. You can reach the sitemap with the url `http:yourwebsite.net/cache/sitemap.xml` and add the sitemap to the google search console. The sitemap will update once a day. You can also trigger a manual update with a refresh of your browser (F5).
